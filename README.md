# lorcana-app-importer

A simple webpage to create a file readable by the official Lorcana companion app. It will take the export.csv from Dreamborn (https://dreamborn.ink) and creates a json file the official Lorcana app can read. Please read this file in total before using this.

# Important notes

Generally, the necessary code to create the userdata.json file for the app runs locally in your browser. It does not upload anything to any server. I do not have access to iOS devices so I cannot say anything about that. I am pretty sure it should be language independent, but I do not have the time nor ressources to test this in other languages or Apple devices. Overwriting the file on your phone with the file generated by this script will make you loose decks and wishlists on your phone.

# Current limitations

- Mickey Mouse - True Friend (promo) cannot be imported, this card does not show in the app for me.
- A whole new world (promo) cannot be imported, this card does not show in the app for me.
- Dreamborn currently does not support rainbow / starter deck foils.

# Prerequisites

- Having a collection at Dreamborn to export your collection.
- Having a cabled connection to your Android phone to access its file system.

# Bug reports

There is always a chance of incorrectly imported cards. If you encounter any bugs, drop a mail at lorcanaappimporter@posteo.de. Please be very specific with the cards you wanted to import and what happened you think was wrong. I will need your export.csv from Dreamborn (remove stuff you do not want to show) and the text from your terminal (if any).
